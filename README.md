    - *40 / 100 / 300 / 1200 * (level + 1) points* for 1, 2, 3, or 4 simultaneous line clears, respectively

## ‚ùóSupport issues:
 - **Board Clearing not working**:
      - In some rare cases, board clearances may not work. Please let me know about any OSs on which this happens. Supported OS: Windows, macOS, major Linux distros.
 - **Terminal version**:
      - Your text editor's / IDE's terminal has to support 24-bit TrueColor for the color schemes to work. Most modern consoles, such as VSCode, support this feature.

## Please let me know about any issues you experience during use. I would greatly appreciate it.
