# NES Tetris clone || Complete! üéâ
This project was purely written in Python.

As of 2025. 07. 27, the game is entirely playable through the terminal. Other additions, such as levels and scoring, are still yet to be added.

## How to run:
- Clone the project onto your computer, or download the files directly.
- Before running, make sure to install the keyboard module, as it is required for user piece movement:
```bash
pip install keyboard
```
- Run main.py either through the Windows Terminal or in your code editor.
### Controls:
  - Move Left: A
  - Move Right: D
  - Soft Drop: S (Hold)
  - Rotate Clockwise: R

### Scoring:
  - Soft dropping:
    - *1 point* / cell held down on
  - Line clears:
    - *40 / 100 / 300 / 1200 * (level + 1) points* for 1, 2, 3, or 4 simultaneous line clears, respectively

## ‚ùóSupport issues:
 - **Board Clearing not working**:
      - In some rare cases, board clearances may not work. Please let me know about any OSs on which this happens. Supported OS: Windows, macOS, major Linux distros.
 - **Terminal version**:
      - Your text editor's / IDE's terminal has to support 24-bit TrueColor for the color schemes to work.

## Please let me know about any issues you experience during use. I would greatly appreciate it.
